 Build your program slowly.
 You will need multiple loops
 
 start by displaying the playerâ€™s choices.
 Get their input.
 Check if the input is correct.
 Make a function to contain this functionality.
 Call your function for each player, and determine who wins.
 Adjust for ties.
 Display the winner.
 Then create multiple games using a loop.
 Then determine the overall winner.
